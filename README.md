# Bank-Project

There's input and output files, when you run the program the input will be read in as accounts. There's also a test cases file, that is used to run transactions instead of the terminal, if you wish to try it out you'll have to type in the transaction letter seen in the menu and account number unto the testcases file. After you run the program all transactions and unsorted/sorted variations of the accounts list will be displayed in the output file.
